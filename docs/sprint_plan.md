Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal

Implement core task scheduling and execution system with basic user authentication to enable
fundamental AI agent operations.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks (7 items)

### High Priority

1. Implement task queue for pending tasks

    - Effort: 5 story points
    - Dependencies: None
    - Risks: Potential scalability issues with large number of tasks

2. Create scheduler for task execution

    - Effort: 8 story points
    - Dependencies: Task queue implementation
    - Risks: Complexity in handling concurrent tasks

3. Implement task breakdown into subtasks

    - Effort: 5 story points
    - Dependencies: Task queue and scheduler
    - Risks: Ensuring proper task hierarchy and relationships

4. Develop core AI agent execution loop

    - Effort: 13 story points
    - Dependencies: Task scheduling system
    - Risks: Integration challenges with existing tools and connectors

5. Implement user login functionality
    - Effort: 5 story points
    - Dependencies: None
    - Risks: Security vulnerabilities if not properly implemented

### Medium Priority

6. Enhance logging for AI model calls

    - Effort: 3 story points
    - Dependencies: None
    - Risks: Potential performance impact with verbose logging

7. Implement auto-refresh for task logs and artifacts
    - Effort: 3 story points
    - Dependencies: Enhanced logging system
    - Risks: Increased server load with frequent updates

## Definition of Done

-   All code is written, reviewed, and merged into the main branch
-   Unit tests are written and passing for new functionality
-   Integration tests are updated and passing
-   User authentication is secure and working as expected
-   Task scheduling system can handle basic task submission, queuing, and execution
-   AI agent can successfully complete a simple end-to-end task using the new execution loop
-   Logging system provides clear and useful information for debugging and monitoring
-   Documentation is updated to reflect new features and changes
-   All selected user stories/tasks are completed and meet acceptance criteria
-   The system is deployed to a staging environment and passes basic functionality tests
```

This sprint plan focuses on implementing the core task scheduling and execution system, which is
crucial for the AI agent's operations. It also includes user authentication to ensure secure access
to the system. The plan prioritizes the high-priority items from the backlog while including two
medium-priority items related to logging, which will be essential for debugging and monitoring the
new functionality.

The estimated effort is provided in story points, with higher points indicating more complex or
time-consuming tasks. Dependencies and risks are noted for each item to help with sprint planning
and risk management.

The Definition of Done ensures that all aspects of the new functionality are properly implemented,
tested, and documented before the sprint is considered complete. This includes both technical
aspects (code quality, testing) and user-facing elements (functionality, documentation).
