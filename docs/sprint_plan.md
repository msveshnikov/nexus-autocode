Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal
Implement core user authentication and task management functionality to establish a secure and interactive foundation for the Nexus AI Framework.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks (Priority Order)

1. Implement user authentication system (High Priority)
   - Estimated effort: 13 story points
   - Tasks:
     a. Create login functionality
     b. Create signup functionality
     c. Integrate with existing app.ejs
     d. Secure routes and API endpoints

2. Develop RESTful API endpoints for task management (High Priority)
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - Tasks:
     a. Create endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks
     b. Implement error handling and validation

3. Enhance UI with dynamic EJS forms for task input (High Priority)
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - Tasks:
     a. Create reusable EJS components for task input
     b. Implement client-side form validation

4. Set up WebSocket server for real-time updates (Medium Priority)
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - Tasks:
     a. Implement WebSocket server
     b. Create basic client-side listeners

5. Design plugin architecture for community contributions (Medium Priority)
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - Tasks:
     a. Define plugin interface and lifecycle
     b. Create documentation outline for plugin development

## Dependencies and Risks

- User authentication (Task 1) must be completed before securing routes and API endpoints.
- RESTful API endpoints (Task 2) should be developed in parallel with UI enhancements (Task 3) to ensure proper integration.
- WebSocket implementation (Task 4) depends on having a basic task management system in place (Tasks 2 and 3).
- The plugin architecture design (Task 5) can be done independently but may require adjustments based on the final implementation of the core system.

Risks:
- Integration of authentication with existing app.ejs may reveal unforeseen complexities.
- Ensuring proper security measures in the authentication system might require additional time and expertise.
- The complexity of real-time updates via WebSockets may impact the estimated effort.

## Definition of Done

The sprint will be considered complete when:

1. All selected user stories/tasks are implemented and functional.
2. Code has been reviewed and meets the project's coding standards.
3. Unit tests are written and passing for new functionality.
4. User authentication is secure and working correctly with the existing app.ejs.
5. RESTful API endpoints for task management are documented and tested.
6. Dynamic EJS forms are responsive and properly validated.
7. WebSocket server is set up and basic real-time updates are functional.
8. Initial plugin architecture design is documented and reviewed by the team.
9. All new features are deployed to the staging environment and pass integration tests.
10. Sprint demo has been prepared to showcase the new functionality to stakeholders.
```

This sprint plan focuses on establishing the core functionality of user authentication and task management, which are crucial for the Nexus AI Framework. The selected tasks provide a balance between backend and frontend development, ensuring that we create a solid foundation for future sprints. The inclusion of the plugin architecture design also sets the stage for community contributions in upcoming sprints.
