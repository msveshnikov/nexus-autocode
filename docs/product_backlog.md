5. Enhance UI with dynamic task management
    - Create reusable EJS components for task input and display
    - Implement client-side form validation
    - Add real-time updates for task status

## Medium Priority

6. Develop plugin ecosystem for community contributions

    - Design plugin architecture
    - Create documentation for plugin development
    - Implement plugin discovery and registration system

7. Implement advanced analytics and reporting features

    - Design dashboard for system performance metrics
    - Create visualizations for task completion rates and resource usage

8. Enhance RAG-based knowledge management

    - Implement efficient indexing and retrieval system
    - Integrate with existing task solving workflow

9. Optimize landing page design

    - Add parallax effects and animations
    - Include more detailed information about the project

10. Develop multi-agent collaboration protocols
    - Design communication standards between agents
    - Implement task delegation and result aggregation

## Low Priority

11. Create a CLI tool for local task management

    -   Develop command-line interface for task submission and monitoring
    -   Ensure compatibility with the web interface

12. Implement multi-language support for the UI

    -   Set up internationalization framework
    -   Create translations for major languages

13. Develop a visual workflow builder for complex tasks

    -   Design drag-and-drop interface for task composition
    -   Integrate with existing task management system

14. Implement a recommendation system for tool selection
    -   Analyze past task performance to suggest optimal tools
    -   Develop a learning mechanism to improve recommendations over time

## Completed Items

-   ~~Set up basic project structure~~
-   ~~Implement Docker support for containerization~~
-   ~~Create initial README with project overview~~
-   ~~Develop RESTful API endpoints for task management~~

## Additional Notes

-   The high priority now focuses on core functionality of task scheduling, execution, and the AI
    agent loop, which are essential for the system's operation.
-   User authentication remains a high priority to ensure secure access to the system.
-   The plugin ecosystem has been moved to medium priority, balancing the need for extensibility
    with core feature development.
-   New items have been added to reflect the TODO list from the README, such as enhancing logging
    and optimizing the landing page design.
-   The backlog now better aligns with the immediate development needs while still maintaining a
    vision for future enhancements.
```

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project, prioritizing core functionality and
user experience while also considering long-term goals. The high-priority items focus on
establishing the essential features for task management and AI agent operations, which are crucial
for the system's functionality and adoption. Medium and low priority items balance the need for
extensibility, user experience improvements, and advanced features.
