## Additional Notes

-   The high-priority focus on user authentication and task management API reflects the immediate
    need for a functional and secure base system.
-   The plugin ecosystem has been moved up in priority to encourage community contributions earlier
    in the development process.
-   Performance optimization and scalability have been adjusted to medium priority, as they become
    more critical as the system grows.
-   New items related to ethical considerations and user onboarding have been added to ensure
    responsible AI development and improved user experience.
```

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project, prioritizing core functionality and
user experience while also considering long-term goals and ethical considerations. The high-priority
items focus on establishing a solid foundation for user interaction and task management, which are
crucial for the system's usability and adoption.
