## Design Considerations

### Architecture

-   Modular design for easy extension and customization
-   Microservices-based approach for scalability
-   Event-driven communication between components
-   Containerization for consistent deployment
-   Service mesh for improved inter-service communication
-   NodeJS, ES6 imports, ExpressJS for dashboard

### AI Models

-   Use models with good tooling (gpt-4/gpt-3.5-turbo, gemini pro/gemini nano, Claude 3/Claude 2.1)
-   Pair models (cost-effective and high-performance) for different tasks
-   Meta-learning for quick adaptation to new tasks
-   Federated learning for privacy-preserving model updates
-   Model compression techniques for edge deployment
