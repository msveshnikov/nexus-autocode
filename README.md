## Project Structure

-   Docker support for containerization
-   Separate modules for different AI providers (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, Together)
-   Utility modules for common functionalities (auth, email, image processing, search, YouTube)
-   Scheduler for task management
-   Tools module for integrating various tools
-   Python scripts for shell interactions on different platforms
-   Model directory for data models (Artifact, User)
-   Public directory for static assets and EJS templates

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables for API keys and configurations
4. Run the application: `npm start`
5. Access the web dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/app`

## Development Roadmap

-   Implement web dashboard for task initiation and progress tracking
-   Develop RESTful API endpoints for task management
-   Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
-   Implement advanced analytics and reporting features

# TODO

-   create scheduling for resoling task (and breaking into subtasks)
-   after initiation task should be in queue for execution
-   auto refresh task logs and artifacts
-   make logs colorful
