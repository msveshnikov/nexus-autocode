## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables for API keys and configurations
4. Run the application: `npm start`
5. Access the web dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/app`

## Development Roadmap

-   Implement web dashboard for task initiation and progress tracking
-   Develop RESTful API endpoints for task management
-   Implement real-time updates using WebSockets
-   Implement advanced analytics and reporting features
-   Develop AI model fine-tuning pipeline
-   Implement multi-agent collaboration protocols
-   Create a marketplace for community-contributed tools and plugins
-   Develop a mobile app for on-the-go task management
-   Implement natural language processing for voice-based task submission
-   Integrate with popular project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello)

# TODO

-  fix no userId param in scheduler call to findPendingTasks() - you should process pending tasks from all users
